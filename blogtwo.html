        I struggled significantly last year with web APIs and JavaScript to the
        point where I hoped I would never have to see or deal with either of
        them again. But this year I really want to get better at working with
        both, primarily JavaScript. The one thing I find most fascinating about
        APIs is they allow you to draw from a large pool of information and
        especially allow for the creation of interactive works and interesting
        works.

        This week’s reading was a bit difficult for me to follow and how it
        relates to interactive media and net art. The reading tackled the topic
        of conventions and my understanding of conventions through the reading
        refers to a shared agreement to the way something should or is done. But
        context is what creates differences in conventions. The way I understand
        it is that there are conventions to writing a comic for example, but the
        context may be the genre is what makes a difference. I could be
        completely wrong so please let me know if I am.

        I have managed to grow to like net art this week especially after having
        a discussion in class and seeing previous students’ works. I managed to
        draw inspiration from their work last week I complained about the web
        art not being aesthetically pleasing which s the main thing that
        irritated me. I also don’t understand why when you google web art the
        most bizarre stuff pops up and why there aren’t more modern examples of
        web art.
      </p>

      <p>
        From looking at previous students’ work I figured that I can make
        something that is aesthetically pleasing. I particularly liked Iman
        Raffee and Michaels Parkins’ work, particularly because of the aesthetic
        appeal and interactivity of both. On Iman’s sight when you hovered over
        the links little waves appeared which I really liked. Everything about
        the site tied in together and was very unified nothing felt out of place
        and it’s minimalistic and very pleasing to the eye. I liked that you
        could interact with the artwork also.
      </p>

      <p>
        In Michaels’ work, I liked the sense of interactivity the site gives
        from the very start and the overall design and aesthetic of the site.
        For my site and web art, I want to create a collage because I want to
        center the site around black women’s hair which is something that is of
        interest to me and is an art form in itself. And explore creating
        collages of images or videos. And the other idea I had was to make the
        artwork basically a Pinterest kind of page where you type in the kind of
        hairstyle you want to see like braids and a whole bunch of images and
        videos will pop up and you can click on them to learn more about the
        type of hairstyle.
