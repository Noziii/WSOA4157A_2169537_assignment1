        According to research internet art refers to art that is made on and for the internet. So far, I hadn’t seen any internet art that is appealing to me. (Tate, n.d.)  To me, art refers to something that is appealing to the eye whether it is interactive or not. I was under the impression that my artwork had to look like the works I have seen such as Exhausting a Crowd by Kyle McDonald which is an amazing interactive piece that runs in time. 
      </p>

      <p>I chose to take art for what it is something pleasing to look at or an aspect that I think is art. According to research, the term art includes diverse media such as painting, sculptures, printmaking, drawing, photography, and installation. (The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica, 2023) Which is why I decided to create a collage. Which incorporates different aspects of art the first being the abstract collage I have created through the images I have put together. The images themselves serve as artwork works that is photography. And lastly, something that I consider to be an art form which is black women’s hair. </p>

      <p>The way in which black women’s hair can transform is an art form, it can take any shape, colour, and form that is desired. My portrait collage is made of various images displaying different states a black women’s hair can take, and different hairstyles. And when the user clicks on the images, they can access information about that specific hairstyle how to do it, how to take care of it, how long it lasts, how long it takes to do it, and products to use to take care of it. </p>
