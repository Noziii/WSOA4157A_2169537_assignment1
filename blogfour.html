      <p>20 April 2023</p>
      <p>
        To start of let us give a brief definition of UI and UX. UI refers to the aesthetic design of an application’s interface, and UX refers to designing the application
        to make it usable and accessible to users. My site is based on aesthetics the entire site in itslef acts as part of my art piece. 
        My site is dedicated to the appreciation of the art form that is black womens hair. 
      </p>

      <p>1) Consistency:</p>
      <p>
        The site makes use of simple navigation 
        tools the menu bar remains at the top right hand corner of every page. That way the user does not getconfused. 
        There is a consistent use of colour among all the page creating harmony.  (Maze, 2022)
      </p>
      
      <p>2) Readability and Legibility:</p>
      <p>
         My site does not contain much writing but I have made sure 
         that all writing is written in a font that is readable and legible.
         Headings are written in larger font to distinguish from the main writing. Writing is provided with padding when it is
          inside a container so that it does not look squashed. There is enough space in between sentences 
          and text is aligned to the left. I primarily made use of the open sans and fonts which make it
           easy to distingusih each words characters from each other.  (The Basic Principles of User Interface Design, 2022)
      </p>

      <p>3)Shortcuts:</p>
      <p>
        I have provided “next” and “previous”
        buttons on my blog post pages and other respective pages in the design
        tab, so the user can click on them to take them to the next blog post
        or the previous one. As well as a “back” button that will automatically
        take them back to the  blog or design page. (Maze, 2022)
      </p>

      <p>4) Feedback:</p>
      <p>
        It is important for the user to know where they are and what is going on. The site
        gives the user back useful feedback, in various ways when hovering over
        the menu the pointer will change to let the user know that it
        is clickable and the page, they are currently on will be highlighted in
        the menu to show where the user is. Similarly, for the cards on the
        design page when the user hovers over the cards the pointer will change
        to give the user feedback that they can click on it. On the Blog page there is 
        a button provided for the user to click so they can read the desired post. For the art page 
        the user can hover over the images and it will blur and the cursor 
        will chaneg to indicate that the image is clickable. (Maze, 2022)
      </p>

      <p>5) Responsive</p>
      <p>
        Certain parts of the site are responsive such as some text and the menu but other aspects such as images 
        i struggle to have them be resposnive. (Maze, 2022)
      </p>

      <p>6) Clarity</p>
      <p>
        My site provides the user with very clear indications of where they are and what to 
        do through the menu  and various other buttons made available.
         (The Basic Principles of User Interface Design, 2022)
      </p>

      <p>7) Visual Hiearchy</p>
      <p>
        This aims at telling the user how to take in information or what is important as soon as they open a page. This can be done in various ways such as through
        size, colour, and dominance. On my site, the way I  represent visual
        hierarchy is through size and colour. On my pages, the title of the page
        is represented in much larger text and is bold and usually at the top of
        the page this tells the user immediately what to expect from the start
        of the page. On my blog posts, the title of the blog post is in
        larger font at the top of the page and in a different font style indicating that it is 
        important but also differs from the main text but rather gives an indication about what the main text is about. 
        These differences help the
        user to identify which information is important. The large text or bold
        text immediately prompts the user to read that first and if that is the
        aim then that is how you draw attention to important information.  (Maze, 2022)
